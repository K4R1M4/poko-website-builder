# The Region

Ideally located at the crossroads of Lazio, Umbria, and Tuscany, our azienda is the perfect base for numerous excursions and visits. Just a short walk away lies the Corviano Nature Reserve, a rich blend of biodiversity, culture, and archaeology. Here, you can explore Etruscan necropolises and medieval sites like the Cascata del Martelluzzo.


A bit further afield—only a 15-minute drive—is the Sacro Bosco, the Monster Park of Bomarzo. These extravagant Renaissance gardens, filled with strange and sometimes eerie sculptures, are sure to cap.

Several must-see Italian cities are also well worth a visit: Rome (90 km), Florence (200 km), Viterbo (10 km), Orvieto (50 km).
Fancy sunbathing by the water or enjoying a boat ride?
Lake Bolsena (30 km) and Montalto beach (70 km) are ideal destinations for sunny days.

Dreaming of taking part in the azienda’s activities? You can!
If your stay falls during the grape or olive harvest, for example, you’ll have the chance to join us and enjoy a unique experience discovering our passion.

This is just a glimpse of what our beautiful region has to offer: we are at your full disposal to help you plan your stay according to your wishes.
