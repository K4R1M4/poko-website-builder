# The Farm

![The farm-photo](/_images/BAE19F68-358C-466B-9059-58397E9EEEC3.webp)

Lost in the Viterbo countryside, in the heart of Tuscia — the land of the Etruscans — one immediately feels soothed by the calm and the magnificent view over the nearby Umbrian hills.

A strada bianca — one of those unpaved gravel roads that wind through the fields — leads to this beautiful 10-hectare estate, cultivated using organic farming methods.

A 1.5-hectare vineyard, around a hundred olive trees, a vegetable garden, fruit trees, beehives, a guest room, and a table d’hôtes make up the estate’s main activities.

Bordered by a cliff, from which one can glimpse the remains of ancient underground Etruscan dwellings, and by nearby nature reserves like Corviano — known for its rich biodiversity — the estate enjoys an ideal environment for high-quality organic agriculture.

What’s more, the volcanic soil from the lands around Lake Bolsena — formed by the collapse of the Vulsini Mountains' craters — brings both fertility and balance to the crops.

It’s in this little corner of paradise that we learn each day to better understand the nature surrounding us, and strive to elevate the products we grow, with deep respect and love for the land we’ve been entrusted with.

## The Vineyard and the Wine {.h3}

We planted our vineyard in January 2020. When choosing grape varieties, we naturally opted for native ones, aiming to craft wines that reflect and respect the local terroir: Trebbiano Toscano, Malvasia, and Vermentino for the whites; Sangiovese and Ciliegiolo for the reds. We produced our first cuvée in 2024.

Our wines are pure and healthy, made using organic farming methods and a clean, low-intervention winemaking approach.

## The Olive Trees {.h3}

122 olive trees of the Moraiolo, Leccino, and Frantoio varieties are spread across the estate.

Our extra virgin olive oil is made from olives that have not undergone any chemical treatment, and is obtained directly by pressing the fruit, without any additives.

The result: a natural, unfiltered oil, rich in vitamin E and other antioxidants.

## The Orchard {.h3}

Apple trees, apricot trees, jujube trees, cherry trees, and various plum trees give Eric the chance to prepare delicious jam that you’ll enjoy at breakfast.

## The Vegetable Garden {.h3}

We grow our own vegetables and aromatic herbs in a greenhouse and natural garden designed according to permaculture principles—without pesticides or herbicides.

As the seasons change, Eric, a chef with a deep passion for cooking, prepares dishes for our guests using the fresh produce we harvest.

## The Beehives {.h3}

The estate has 10 bee colonies. We produce our own wildflower Millefiori honey.

We chose to place our hives in the middle of a neighboring 80-hectare plot of organically farmed land, providing our bees with an ideal environment to forage and create honey of exceptional quality.
