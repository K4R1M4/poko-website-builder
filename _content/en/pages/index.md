More than just a room... {.h2}

Una Scelta is the journey of Karima and Eric, two Italians at heart who left Belgium to plant roots in Soriano nel Cimino, nestled in the peaceful countryside of Viterbo.

On their 10-hectare estate, they grow vegetables, produce wine and olive oil, and welcome guests into a serene and exclusive setting — an immersive experience in harmony with nature.

Stays here are about connection: comfortable accommodation, heartfelt conversations,  cooking class, scenic walks, home-cooked meals, travel planning and meaningful discoveries.

A stay that’s simple, genuine, and full of life.
